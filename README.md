# Video-Game-Project
What made me want to change the script was the speed I wanted my sprite to land mainly because I wanted the landing to be slow so my audience wouldn't be confused at the speed at which the player jumped when the clicked the jump button.
My main challenge was the coding and knowing where to add the coding because to understand coding is a huge struggle for me as I cannot fully grasp the consept of video game making.
I watched several vidoes on my issue, which was abl to fix my problem, these videos clarified my questions and showed me better ways to code. I was able to code multiple scripts with great ease because of it.
So far I am most proud of the design of my game. This is because my design captures what I chose to present, showing the childlike innocence and simplicity of the game.
